									<p>In this Lab the basic structure of microprocessor based control was introduced slo0ng with the experimental and rapid control prototyping environment(simulink, simulink- coder and Simulink Desktop Real- Time, Implementation and tuning of P, PI , PID controllers were also introduced.
										 The aim of this experiment was to generate analogue and digital/binary test signals, implement and test basic controllers in real-time and use MATLAB/SIMULINK for Data processing . <br><a href="images/matlab pdf 1.pdf">please click here to view Report!</a></p>

									<div class="report">
									<p>Motors have wide range of applications in almost all industrial sectors. In order to design a speed or position controller for a motor, its mathematical model is needed which requires its parameter estimation The motor used in this experiment is a permanent-magnet dc machine.
										The motor shaft is attached to a flywheel and a small three-phase generator, which is connected to a resistive load. This load can be switched on or off with the help of an electronic relay. A power amplifier is used to provide electrical power needed for the motor. The output voltage
										 of the power amplifier is controlled by an analog signal u. The speed of the motor is measured by means of a tacho-generator. The tacho-generator generates a DC voltage signal, which is proportional to the shaft speed. A current sensor measures the current flowing through motor coils.The 
										 experiment will be performed using the rapid-prototyping system. <br><a href="images/matlab pdf 2.pdf">please click here to view Report!</a> </p>

									<p>Two control schemes are to be implemented to control the temperature in the acryl glass tube. The first control scheme is based on an on-off controller. This scheme is also known as bang-bang contre switching control or two-position control. The second option uses a Pl controllers parameters 
										are determined by using the tuning rules formulated by Chien, Hrones and Reswick (abbreviation CHR). These tuning rules, can be divided into two categories: set-point tracking and disturbance rejection. In both cases, the control loop can be optimised to achieve either 
										20% overshoot or no overshoot.For the calculation of controller parameters, an explicit derivation of the transfer function of the plant is not needed. Parameters describing the characteristic behaviour of the plant can be determined from its step response. These parameters include time delay T.,
										 rise time T, and steady state gain Ks. The controller parameters are calculated based on these plant parameters. <br><a href="images/matlab pdf 3.pdf">please click here to view Report!</a></p>

									<div class="report">
									<p>In this Exercise some classical controllers like P,PI,PIDT1 controllers are designed and evaluated for different plants . The investigation will be carried out using 3 plant models with different characteristics namely Plant -A,B and C.Plant A is a second-order system with one pole on the origin of 
										the s plane. This means that the plant A an integral behaviour Plant B is an over-damped third-order system with three real poles. This can be considered as a series connection of three first-order (PTI) systems. Examples of such systems can be found in the chemical and process industry.Plant C is 
										an under-damped third-order system (series connection of a first-order system with an under damped second-order system). Typical examples are vehicle drivelines, flexible arm robot manipulatorsor electrical transmission lines. <br><a href="images/matlab pdf 4.pdf">please click here to view Report!</a></p>

									<div class="report">
									<p>The purpose of this experiment is is to design, implement and test a speed control scheme for a DC motor.The permanent-magnet DC motor is actuated with the help of a PWM-based power amplifier A three-phase AC generator connected with a resistive circuit is used to load the driveline. This load can be
										 switched on or off manually A flywheel on the drive axle increases the moment of inertia. The control scheme will be implemented using the Simulink Desktop Real-Time (SLDRT) environment. The armature voltage u Le the output voltage of the power amplifier is proportional to the control signal ir of 
										 the digital controller. The speed of the motor is measured by a tacho-generator (TG). The tacho-generator is an analogue speed sensor, which converts the peed into a voltage signal. This signal is digitised using the Al 0 channel of the AD converter. A current sensor measures the armature current.
										  The signal delivered by the current sensor is read in via channel Al 1 The status of the load switch is read in using the DI 0 digital input. <br><a href="images/matlab pdf 5.pdf">please click here to view Report!</a></p>
